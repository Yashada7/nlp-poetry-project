        "*   'Imagery and Sensory Details', 'Structure, Form, and Cohesion', 'Rhythm, Sound Devices, and Musicality', and 'Originality and Innovation' each scored 9.\n",
        "*   'Theme and Depth of Message' and 'Emotional Impact and Resonance' received slightly lower, but still strong, scores of 8.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The poem excels particularly in its use of figurative language and word choice, suggesting a strong command of poetic expression and vivid descriptions.\n",
        "*   To further enhance the poem, consider exploring avenues to deepen its thematic complexity or amplify its emotional resonance, as these areas scored slightly lower compared to other metrics.\n"
